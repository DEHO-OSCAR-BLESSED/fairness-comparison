This repository is meant to facilitate the benchmarking of fairness aware machine learning algorithms.

To run the benchmarks, download the repository, and run the demo_all.py file.

This will produce a set of results files in OORESULT.

Then run calculate_scores.py, which will calculate a series of fairness metrics on these results, and can be found in the OOCALCULATIONS file.


Drawing heavily on original code from:

https://github.com/mbilalzafar/fair-classification

https://github.com/tkamishima/kamfadm



As for a layout of the repository:

Data can be found in the data folder. New datasets should be added their own sub-folder.

fadm is the folder containing Kamashima's original code.

adult_benchmarks, compas_benchmarks, and german_benchmarks actually perform the various the benchmarks. These are all called in demo_all.py

Currently the Feldmen repair code is not working, and should probably be entirely re-implemented.

UPDATE 7/28/2017:
  Algorithms each have own dir, with an algorithm class inside, specific to each algorithm (ex: Kamishima, Zafar, etc.)
  Data is found in the data dir, with each data set getting its own sub-dir.
  Audits is where all of the audit results are stored.
  Metrics contains the Metric class that calculates different metrics.
  Misc contains benchmark scripts for Adult, Compas, and German data sets. It also contains necessary files for Zafar, Kamishima, Calders, and Feldman algorithms.
  Preprocessing contains the methods that prepare each data set to be run through the metrics.
  
  To run the working metrics on the Adult and German data sets, cd into the outermost dir and run "python print_metrics.py".
