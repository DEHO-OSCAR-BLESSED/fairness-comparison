Each algorithm has its own subdirectory containing an algorithm class file, an init file, and any files necessary to run the algorithm. For example, the Calders algorithm runs functions from two_naive_bayes.py, so that file is found in the calders subdirectory.

The [Name]Algorithm.py extends the AbstractAlgorithm class and must import from everything from AbstractAlgorithm, any files from which it needs to draw functions, and the datetime module. From there, add a run function that takes inputs specified in the AbstractAlgorithm class and outputs a list of original class values (integers), a list of class values predicted by your algorithm, a list of protected values, and a time (timedelta object). All lists should have the same ordering so that the original and predicted indices match up with the protected indices.
