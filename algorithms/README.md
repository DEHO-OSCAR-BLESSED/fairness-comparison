# Adding a new algorithm

1. Make a new directory named after the first author of the relevant paper.
2. In the new directory create a file named <FirstAuthor>Algorithm.py that extends Algorithm.py and implements its run method.
3. Add any additional needed code in that directory or a subdirectory.
4. Add the algorithm to list.py.
5. Add citation information to this README.
