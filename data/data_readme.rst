Three data folders: adult, german, and propublica.

Each file has the original raw data, cleaned data, and a fixer.py file which I used for various data cleaning.

"Original" datafiles can be found online at

Adult: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

German: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)

ProPublica: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
