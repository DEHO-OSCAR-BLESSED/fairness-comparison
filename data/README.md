## Adding a data set

To add a data set, you need to:
1. Choose a single word lower case *name* to identify your data set.
2. Put the raw data set in the raw/ directory at *name*.csv
3. Create a class *Name*.py that extends Data.py and implements all the required methods.  Add it to datasets/
4. Add your dataset object to the list at datasets/list.py
